            That's why U.S. News considered a variety of factors, such as attractions, accommodations 
            and dining options, as well as votes from thousands of travelers, to determine the best places 
            to visit in the USA. Use this list for your vacation planning, and cast your vote below to 
            have a say in next year's list.
